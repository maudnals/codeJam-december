# Creative code jam december

Speech recognition.

*DEMO: https://maudnals.github.io/creative-code-jam-december/*

### Required:
* Open in Chrome desktop
* Accept the microphone permission
* Optionnally, load the script manually (http vs https -> tagged as "unsafe" by chrome). To do so, click on the little shield icon that will appear on the right of chrome's search bar.

### How to play:
Simply speak (in English) next to your laptop's microphone.
Use a negative word from time to time to observe the behaviour.
Say stuff and enjoy the nonsense!

### Troubleshooting
* "I speak next to my microphone but nothing happens." -> See points #1 and #2 in the "Required section" above
* "I do see my words being displayed as I speak, but can't see any image." -> See point #3 in the "Required section" above
